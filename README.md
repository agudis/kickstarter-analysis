# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

The play *Fever* came close to its fundraising goal in a short period of time. We want to determine the outcomes of different theater campaigns based on the launch dates and fundraising goals. By completing this analysis, we can see what factors into the success of other campaigns. 

### Purpose

The purpose is to determine if there are trends or correlations of the success of a campaign based on when they are launched and what their fundraising goal is. 

## Analysis and Challenges

We are going to analyze two different data sets to help us determine the success of different campaigns. We will look at outcomes based on the launch date and based on the fundraising goal. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

We want to see when the theater campaigns are launched and what the outcome was based on that launch date. The best way to analyze this is to create a pivot table. The pivot table should be able to filter by the parent category of theater and the year. This will allow us to see when successful, failed and canceled campaigns were launched. 

It is not necessary to show live campaigns in our data as we do not yet know the outcome of that campaign. From the pivot table we want to create a line graph to better visualize our trends.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Next, we want to determine what the outcomes of theater campaigns were based on the fundraising goals they had set. The data we have has many different fundraising goals. First, we determined that we would look at the goals by 12 different dollar amount ranges. From the number that were successful, number that failed and number that were canceled based on the fundraising goal. 

Next, we totaled up the number of successful, failed and canceled projects in each dollar amount goal. This allowed us to determine the percentage of campaigns that were successful, failed and canceled. 

Lastly, will all of this data a line chart was created to see the percentage of each outcome in correlation to the amount of the fundraising goal.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

When the pivot table showing theater outcomes versus launch date was first created, it was showing each month and year separately. It was determined it would be best to look at this data by month only as you could filter for all years or a specific year. By setting the pivot table to only show month, we can more clearly analyze the trends. 

## Results

- Theater campaigns have the highest chance of being successful if they are launched in May.
- There are more successful theater campaigns launched, no matter the month, than there are failed or canceled campaigns. 
- Theater campaigns are most successful when the fundraising goal is less than $1,000.
- Limitations of the data set include not knowing where the campaigns are taking place and if that has any correlation. Other limitations could include not knowing if there are other events or reasons that contribute to someone not wanting to back a campaign. 
- Further tables and graphs could be used to show if the number of backers and/or donation amount is realted to the success of a campaign.
